# SS201: Principles of Economics

[`Overview`](#overview) | [`Lessons`](#lessons) | [`Acknowledgments`](#acknowledgements)

## Overview
This is an undergraduate economics course taught at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Please see the [syllabus](https://raw.githack.com/chomme3/SS201/main/admin/ss201_ay23_syllabus.pdf) and course overview for more information.

The slides below are best viewed in HTML; however, I have also posted pdf copies for download so cadets may take notes or fill out during the lesson. I will not post solutions to board problems given in the slides, that's what class is for!
