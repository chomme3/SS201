# Employment Rates
</br></br>

*Labor Force Participation Rate*
--
 = $\frac{\text{Labor Force}}{\text{Adult Population}} \times 100$
--
</br></br></br>
*Unemployment Rate*
--
 = $\frac{\text{Number of Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}} \times 100$
--
</br></br></br>
*Employment to Population Ratio*
--
 = $\frac{\text{Number of Employed}}{\text{Adult Population}} \times 100$

# Types of Unemployment
Frictional
- Arises from the process of matching workers to jobs

Structural
- Something in the labor market keeping wages higher than in equilibrium
- Textbook: minimum wage, unions

Natural Rate of Unemployment
- Combination of frictional and structural unemployment
- Unemployment fluctuates around this

Cyclical
- Deviation from this natural rate
- Excess (or temporarily lower) unemployment caused by short-term economic recessions or booms


---
# Why pay more than you *have* to for a worker?

--
“Efficiency wages”

--

Better worker health/nutrition
- Mostly think about this in poor countries

--

Lower worker turnover
- Reduce training costs, etc.

--

Improve worker quality
- Attract many applicants, can be more choosy

--

Increase worker effort
- Want to keep a good job

#The All-Volunteer (AVF) Force
## How do local labor market conditions affect the military?

“…whether it be just in a community, that the richer part should compel the poorer to fight in defen[s]e of them and their properties, for such wages as they think fit to allow, and punish them if they refuse?” – *Benjamin Franklin*

Vietnam War thought of as a “rich man’s war and a poor man’s fight.”

**Do economic conditions influence who enlists and joins?**

To what extent is war among democracies fought by those who have limited economic options? Essentially, **how much weight does patriotism carry in an individual's utility function?**
