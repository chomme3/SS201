4. Parker says that the present value of \$350 to be received one year from today if the interest rate is 6 percent is less than the present value of \$350 to be received two years from today if the interest rate is 3 percent. Ryan says that \$350 saved for one year at 6 percent interest has a smaller future value than \$350 saved for two years at 3 percent interest.
 	a. 	Both Parker and Ryan are correct.
 	b. 	Both Parker and Ryan are incorrect.

5. Suppose that a worker in Cornland can grow either 40 bushels of corn or 10 bushels of oats per year, and a worker in Oatland can grow either 5 bushels of corn or 50 bushels of oats per year. There are 20 workers in Cornland and 20 workers in Oatland. If the two countries do not trade, Cornland will produce and consume 400 bushels of corn and 100 bushels of oats, while Oatland will produce and consume 20 bushels of corn and 800 bushels of oats. If each country made the decision to specialize in producing the good in which it has a comparative advantage, then the combined yearly output of the two countries would increase by
 	a. 	800 bushels of corn and 100 bushels of oats.
 	b. 	380 bushels of corn and 100 bushels of oats.
 	c. 	100 bushels of corn and 380 bushels of oats.
 	d. 	380 bushels of corn and 1000 bushels of oats.

6. Steak and chicken are substitutes. A sharp reduction in the supply of steak would
 	a. 	increase consumer surplus in the market for steak and decrease producer surplus in the market for chicken.
 	b. 	increase consumer surplus in the market for steak and increase producer surplus in the market for chicken.
 	c. 	decrease consumer surplus in the market for steak and increase producer surplus in the market for chicken.
 	d. 	decrease consumer surplus in the market for steak and decrease producer surplus in the market for chicken.

 	a. 	there are a small number of sellers.
 	b. 	strategic interactions among sellers are not important.
 	c. 	sellers are price makers rather than price takers.
 	d. 	there are only a few buyers but many sellers.
