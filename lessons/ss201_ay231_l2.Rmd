# Economic Theory / Modeling
Economics is a **POSITIVE** Social Science
.pull-left[**POSITIVE** Statements...

- Describe the way the world is.
- Are hypotheses to be proven true or false.
]

.pull-right[**NORMATIVE** Statements

- Describe the way the world should be.
- Rely on values and worldviews.
]

.pull-left[
<u>Example:</u>  Women participate in the labor market at a lower rate than men. Career interruptions due to children contribute to much of this difference.
]
.pull-right[
<u>Example:</u> The government should prioritize providing free childcare to increase the participation of women in the workforce.

# Comparative Advantage / Trade

### Economic Leader Principle #1

There is a **trade-off** in every decision a leader makes. What we give up constitutes the **opportunity cost** of a decision.

### Economic Leader Principle #4

**Trade** can make all parties better off by creating a **"win-win."** Leaders realize the benefits from trade by facilitating **specialization** and **comparative advantage** amongst the people they lead.

# Comparative Advantage / Trade
### Board Problem #1
Suppose MAJ Homme can only do two things on a Sunday afternoon: grill steaks or smoke turkeys. If he spends all his time grilling, he can grill 25. If he only smokes turkeys, he can smoke 5 turkeys. Assume he can switch between tasks at a constant rate.

1. Sketch a plausible production possibility frontier curve. Label axes and describe the opportunity cost of smoking 1 turkey.

2. At which point should MAJ Homme produce?  

3. Suppose a new grill allows MAJ Homme to grill faster so that in any fixed amount of time, he can grill more steaks.  What would the new production possibility frontier curve look like?

# Comparative Advantage / Trade
### Board Problem #2
Suppose that in the U.S. producing an aircraft takes 10,000 hours of labor and producing a shirt takes 2 hours of labor.  Suppose that in China producing an aircraft takes 40,000 hours of labor and producing a shirt takes 1 hour of labor.  Suppose China is endowed with 120,000 hours of labor and the U.S. is endowed with 100,000 hours of labor.  
1. What is the opportunity cost of a shirt in the U.S.?  In China? What about an aircraft?

2. Which country has an absolute advantage in aircrafts?  In shirts? What is each countries' comparative advantage?

3. What good will the U.S. export and what is the minimum price they must receive in order to export it?

# Calculus Primer
## Constrained Optimization

So if a derivative tells us rates of change of our function, then how do we find mins / maxes?

1. Find points where your **First-Order Necessary Condition (FONC)** is satisfied (critical points).
  - $f'(x)=0$

2. Find sign of **Second-Order Sufficient Condition (SOSC)** at those critical points.
  - $f''(x)\geq0$ or $f''(x)\leq0$

3. Check your work / confirm those points are better than **"corner solutions."**

## Constrained Optimization in 2D

So if I wanted to maximize $f_1(x) = -(x-7)^2+7$ subject to $f_2(x) = \frac{2}{3} x + \frac{5}{3}$, how would I find it? 

```{r cons, out.width = '80%', fig.align='center', warning=FALSE}
  x = seq(0,20,.01)
  df = data.frame(x)
  
  ggplot(df, aes(x)) +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) -(x-7)^2+7, color = 'gold', size = 2) +
    stat_function(fun = function(x) 2/3*x + (5/3), color = 'black', size = 2) +
    labs(x = "X", y = "f(x)") +
    xlim(4,10) + ylim(2,8) +
    coord_fixed()+
    theme(axis.title.y.left = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
          axis.title.y.right = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
          panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          axis.line = element_line(color = "black"),
          legend.key = element_blank(),
          legend.title = element_blank(),
          legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.box = "horizontal",
          text = element_text(size = 20))
```
