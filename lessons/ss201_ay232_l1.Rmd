# What is economics?

.center[
"If you only like philosophy, then be a philosopher. If you only like history, then be a historian. If you only like mathematics, then be a mathematician. But if you like all of those things, you should be an economist."

*Tim S. Fuerst*
]

.center[
“The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else. Practical [thinkers], who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist.”

*John Maynard Keynes*

# The Economic Leader

.center[Economics is the study of decision-making ... a discipline focused on the optimal allocation of scarce resources that have alternate uses.

Leaders face scarcity in each decision – scarcity in time, people, and resources that have different uses. Leaders seek to allocate resources to their highest valued use.

As such, leadership and economics go hand in hand. **Great leaders are good economists (even when they don’t realize it).**

They realize that correlation does not equal causation. They appreciate the assumptions and associated limitations in the models and perspectives that they use to view the world. 

Leaders are forced to deal with the messy reality, and they recognize that their own biases can influence decision-making.]

# Economic Thinking
### Decisions need to be made on the margin...

Sir / Ma'am, we need to expand the officer corps. Where should we commission more officers from?
1. West Point
2. ROTC (with scholarship)
3. ROTC (no scholarship)
4. OCS (college grad)
5. OCS (enlisted soldier)

# Economic Thinking
### The prisoner's dilemma

Two cadets get accused of cheating. The instructor separates the two and explains that he will punish only the one who copied the other's work. If both do not blame the other, they will have to redo a different assignment. If one cadet blames the other and the other admits, the one who is caught will get turned in for an honor board. If they both blame the other, they both get zeros on the assignment.

# Causal Inference

Economists were among the first "data-scientists"

"Machine learning" and "big data" use algorithms and patterns within data to predict out of sample.

Economists use data and models to find "causal effects" (i.e. "x" caused "y")

#Causal Inference
To find causal effects, economists rely on **natural experiments** or **randomized control trials**

Within these experiments, economists apply statistical techniques in the form of "regressions" to estimate specific effects.

The key challenge within this analysis is to eliminate "selection" and show that the treatment caused the outcome]

# Why no computers in the classroom?

Everyone cares about education. Economists call this "human capital"

Common belief is more education leads to more income

More efficient education produces more income
