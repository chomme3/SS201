3.	Decreasing the length of time a worker can receive unemployment insurance payments.

4.	Providing career counseling services to individuals receiving unemployment insurance.

5.	Increasing the minimum wage in a competitive labor market.

6.	Offering free community college to workers who lose jobs due to outsourcing.

- How much does USAA loan out? What happens to that money?

- What is the relationship between the reserve ratio and the money multiplier?

- How much money will the $1,000 of deposited cash generate through the banking system?

# Show me the Mone(tary) System!
## Quantity Theory of Money

Suppose that you woke up tomorrow and cadet pay was double the amount of dollarsâ€¦ but also all prices you pay (the PX, stores in Highland Falls, Netflix subscriptions, etc.) also doubled.

  - Would anything about your daily life or what you choose to buy change? What do we call this concept in economics?

  - If the price level is 100 today, what will be the price level tomorrow? What has happened to the value of each dollar in your pocket?

  - Graph equilibrium in the market for money. Who defines the demand for money, and what shape does demand have? Who defines the supply of money, and what shape does supply have?

  - On the graph above, draw the effect of the FED buying many government bonds. What happens to the value of money? What about the Price level?

  - What is the velocity of money? What is the relationship between velocity, the price level, the money supply, and GDP?

  - Assuming the velocity of money is stable, explain what happens in the long run when the FED takes action above.

# Show me the Mone(tary) System!
## Inflation and the Money Supply

- "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

- Key Takeaway is that our model assumes money neutrality

- If firms and consumers can all act with perfect information, then purchasing power or "real variables" are unaffected. **Inflation, in this sense, is not bad**.

- Relaxing the above assumption, however, there are instances where money is not neutral and affect real variables. 
  - "Shoe Leather Costs"
  - "Menu Costs"
  - Price Variability and Misallocation
  - Taxes on Nominal Returns

---
# If you educate, they will save?
- So what?

- How do you protect yourself against inflation?

- Even if I told you how, would you listen?

- "Sir/Ma'am, why should I save in my TSP? What's the point?"

---
# If you educate, they will save?
- Skimmyhorn (2016) assesses the affect of financial education among basic trainees

.center[
![:scale 90%](img/skimmy.png)
]

- Outcome variable is binary (i.e. 0 or 1), thus highlighted values interpreted as percents.

- Soldiers who received financial education were 15% more likely (over 100% above the control group) to save in the Thrift Savings Plan.
