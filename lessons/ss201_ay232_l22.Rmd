6. Suppose that a worker in Radioland can produce either 5 radios or 1 television per year, and a worker in Teeveeland can produce either 1 radios or 5 televisions per year. Each nation has 100 workers. Also, suppose that each country completely specializes in producing the good in which it has a comparative advantage.

# Bottom Line Up Front {#sec:bluf}
We can model financial markets the same as a market for any other good. We also apply definitions to what saving and investing look like within our macroeconomy, both private and public. Overall, the identity for income and expenditure still must hold.

# Savings Terminology {#sec:savings}
In economics we make a distinction between savings and investment (and this is different from the way we normally use these terms in business/finance). Savers save and borrowers invest. Putting money into the stock market is SAVING, whereas the company that issued the stock is BORROWING.

1. Define Private Savings.\vspace{3cm}

2. When we say households are "saving" (i.e. private savings increases) what do we mean in practice? What are they actually doing?\vspace{3cm}

3. Name two types of financial intermediaries households actually use when they save?\vspace{3cm}

4. In econ language, what do borrowers borrow money for?\vspace{3cm}

5. How do borrowers "raise" money?\vspace{3cm}

6. Classify the following as a borrower or a saver:
    a. I put some money into the stock market \vspace{1.0cm}
    b. I buy a house using a mortgage \vspace{1.0cm}
    c. Company X becomes public and issues stock \vspace{1.0cm}
    d. Company Y issues bonds \vspace{1.0cm}
    e. I put money into a savings account at the bank \vspace{1.0cm}
    f. I buy a mutual fund \vspace{1.0cm}
    g. A firm decides to increase its capital, say by buying tractors \vspace{1.0cm}

# National, Public, and Private Savings {#sec:publicprivsav}

National Savings (S) is defined as the total income in the economy left over after paying for consumption and government purchases. That is $S = Y – C – G$. It is composed of private savings plus public savings. Private savings is the income households have left after paying for taxes and consumption. Public savings is the tax revenue the government has left after paying for its spending (it can be negative = deficit, or positive = surplus, or zero = balanced).

1. Prove that in a closed economy, $S = I$. That is, for the economy as a whole, savings must equal investment. (Hint: recall that $Y = C + I + G + NX$). \vspace{3cm}

2. Prove that National Savings = Private Savings + Public Savings, where private savings is $Y – C – T$ (T is taxes) and public savings is $T - G$. \vspace{3cm}

3. Suppose GDP equals \$10 trillion, consumption equals \$6.5 trillion, the government spends \$2 trillion and has a budget deficit of \$0.3 trillion. The economy is closed. Find public saving, net taxes, private saving, national saving, and investment. \vspace{3cm}

4. In question 1 you proved that $S = I$ for the economy as a whole. (Note that this is obviously not necessarily true for any individual/firm). What mechanism (or price, or rate) in the economy adjusts so that $S = I$? \vspace{3cm}

# The Market for Loanable Funds (i.e. Capital Markets) {#sec:loanfunds}

For the sake of simplicity, we assume there is just a single financial market in the economy where all borrowers go for the purpose of raising funds for investment and all savers dump their savings. We call this market the market for capital or "the loanable funds market."

1. Draw the market for loanable funds below. Label axes and each curve. Underneath the supply curve, explain who/what makes up the supply curve (word bank: public savings, private savings, private investment). Underneath the demand curve, explain who/what makes up the demand curve (word bank: public savings, private savings, private investment).

```{r g1, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/grid.png")
``` 

2. For each of the following scenarios, determine which curve shifts (supply or demand), which components of supply (private / public savings) change, if any, and state clearly what happens to the interest rate and to total private investment. It may help to draw a figure.
    a. There is a new TV show that starts a savings fad. \vspace{2.0cm}
    b. The government cuts spending (but not taxes). \vspace{2.0cm}
    c. The government cuts taxes, without altering spending. \vspace{2.0cm}
    d. The government offers an investment tax credit (you can assume the impact on the government’s budget is minimal). \vspace{2.0cm}

3. What is meant by the “crowding out” effect of government deficits? \vspace{3cm}
