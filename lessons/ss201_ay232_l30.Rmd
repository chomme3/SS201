# Bottom Line Up Front {#sec:bluf}
Economists have documented how humans are not always rational decision makers. We especially discount time and incorrectly interpret probabilities. We also have a tendency to resort to a “default” option when uncertainty is high or a decision is complex. Life is “OPT-IN” and should rarely resort to a default option. Have a plan, ensure you revisit it and reconfirm its validity. Understand that it will change, but as long as you have an idea of where you are headed, you can always find the most efficient way of getting there. You define your own success!

# Select Microeconomics Review {#sec:appmic}
1.	As an SS201 instructor, part of my challenge is to get a bunch of cadets, whom did not elect to take my course, to spend time studying for my course. As you know, a cadet has many demands on his or her time. As the instructor who prepares each lesson, I know how much effort I want cadets to put into preparation, but I have limited information on how much time available and other graded events each cadet has. Cadets have perfect information about their own schedules, but limited information on how they will be evaluated. What do we call this problem in economics? Within this scenario, what do we call instructors and what do we call cadets? \vspace{3cm}

2.	One of my more unpopular ideas is to buy only new cars. My current vehicle is a 2011 Toyota Tacoma which I bought with my cow loan. Even within my current family, I have never purchased a used car (my wife hates this). Why do I do this? Maybe it’s because I’m weird, but maybe it’s because I’m an economist. What problem am I overcoming by only buying new vehicles? \vspace{3cm}

3.	Eventually, you as battalion commanders, Chief Executive Officers, or leaders of any organization will have to overcome the above information asymmetries within the labor market. What are two mechanisms that applicants and employers will use to avoid the “market for lemons?” \vspace{3cm}

# Behavioral Economics - Time Preferences {#sec:behav}
1. What is behavioral economics and how does it differ from our traditional models? \vspace{3cm}

2. Would you rather take \$100 today or \$110 a week from now? Would you rather take \$100 a year from now or \$110 a year and a week from now? Did your answer change? Why? What is hyperbolic discounting? \vspace{3cm}

3. What do we learn about human behavior from Augenblick et. al (2015)? \vspace{2cm}
